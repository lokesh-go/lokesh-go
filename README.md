### Hey 👋 I'm Lokesh 🙂

A Software Development Engineer who is working on [BookMyShow](https://in.bookmyshow.com) since more than 2.5 years to building and designing the scalable systems.

I love to build the feature from scratch and also enthusiastic about to learn & explore tech in depth. Started to building utility package with example which is mostly used in developing microservices; here are few repositories:

 - [Golang examples](https://github.com/lokesh-go/golang-examples)
 - [Golang mongodb library](https://github.com/lokesh-go/go-mongo-lib)
 - [Vaccine availability notification service](https://github.com/lokesh-go/vaccine-bot-lamda-aws)

Things I am exploring:

 - 🔭 I’m currently exploring CS concept with golang 
 - 🌱 I’m currently learning everything in depth 😛
 - 💬 Talk about CS core concepts & system designs 🖥️
